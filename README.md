# HARFI_Scripts
HARFI processing scripts for MATLAB

calcHARFI.m: runs HARFI on resting state (or task) fMRI data. Returns .mat file with voxel-wise correlation coefficients over spheres

fitHARFI.m: runs HARFI fitting on correlation coefficient data. Returns Spherical Harmonic fits for each voxel, which can be displayed using diffusion MRI visualization tools (visualization and spherical harmonic toolbox repository will be created soon)

Jones60.mat: directions over sphere
